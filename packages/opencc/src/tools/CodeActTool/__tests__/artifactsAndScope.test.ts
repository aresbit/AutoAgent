/**
 * Two things kept CodeAct in glue-script territory, and neither was a bug in
 * the sandbox — the runtime was always capable of far more than it was used
 * for.
 *
 * The first was delivery: "only stdout reaches the model" meant anything
 * visual could be computed and never handed over, so plotting was structurally
 * pointless. The second was the prompt, whose "when to use" list described a
 * better shell script and whose one ambitious line — Python's data science
 * ecosystem — was false, since nothing is preinstalled. A model that tries
 * `import numpy`, gets ModuleNotFoundError, and is told CodeAct is for awk
 * chains learns exactly the lesson it appeared to learn.
