/**
 * Delivery with an answer, instead of a write with a hope.
 *
 * `mailbox.send()` writes a file into a directory and returns. That is all it
 * has ever meant, but it reads as "sent": a sender got no signal when the
 * destination was a session that exited an hour ago, when the address was a
 * typo, or when the envelope expired unread. Combined with the fact that
 * subagents had no receiving end at all, "I sent it and nothing happened" was
 * the normal case and there was nothing to look at afterwards.
 *
 * Three checks, each answering a different question a sender actually has:
 *
 *   reachable   is anyone serving this address right now?
 *   acked       did a receiver take it out of the mailbox?
 *   dead        if not, where did it go?
 *
 * Retries reuse the envelope id on purpose. `send` dedupes on id against the
 * records it still holds, so a retry cannot double-deliver a message that is
 * merely sitting unread; what it does do is restore an envelope that was lost
 * to a truncated or hand-edited mailbox file. That is the only failure a retry
 * can actually repair, and reusing the id is what keeps it from causing a
 * worse one.
