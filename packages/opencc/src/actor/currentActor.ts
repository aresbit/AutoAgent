 * identical address, and three things followed from that one fact:
 *
 *   - `tx` could not name a subagent. Every address a sender could write
 *     pointed at the shared session mailbox.
 *   - the parent's inbox poller claims on delivery, and claiming is
 *     at-most-once, so mail meant for a subagent was consumed into the
 *     parent's conversation and the subagent never saw it.
 *   - `mailbox.list()` showed one actor where there were several.
 *
 * Deriving from agentId keeps the address stable for the agent's whole life
 * and unique between siblings; including agentType keeps it readable in
 * `list()` output, which is how one agent finds another to write to.
