/**
 * The receiving end of actor messaging, for every agent loop.
 *
 * Before this existed there was exactly one receiver in the process: the REPL's
 * inbox poller, mounted in screens/REPL.tsx. Subagents do not render a REPL, so
 * a subagent had no way at all to be handed mail — its only route was to decide,
 * unprompted, to call ActorTool with action 'rx', which a model busy with its
 * own task has no reason to do and no signal telling it to. Messages sat unread
 * in the mailbox until the agent exited.
 *
 * Running at the query() turn boundary fixes it for everyone at once, because
 * every agent loop in this process — the main session and every subagent —
 * goes through query(). The cost is one peek per turn against a small JSON
 * file, which is nothing against the API round trip that follows it.
 *
 * Ordering against the REPL poller is safe without coordination: both deliver
 * first and claim only the ids they actually delivered, and claim is atomic, so
 * whichever gets there first wins and the other sees an empty mailbox. The
 * failure it prevents — claiming mail that arrived between the read and the
 * claim — is the reason claim() is separate from receive() in the first place.
