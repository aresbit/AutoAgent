/**
 * speechToText: a local speech-to-text substrate.
 *
 * The seam a function-hook plugin binds to. Providers advertise themselves through the
 * registry, the recorder captures 16 kHz mono audio from the microphone, the silence
 * gate decides when a capture is finished, and the download helper fetches provider
 * assets resumably. Nothing is registered and nothing is fetched at import time - the
 * consumer decides when to create, register and provision a provider.
