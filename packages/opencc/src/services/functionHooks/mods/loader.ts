/**
 * Loading mods into the chain.
 *
 * Three things happen here that `loadHooksModule` does not do, and they are
 * the reason this layer exists rather than the loader being called directly:
 *
 *   - `$` is scoped. A mod's hooks are wrapped so they receive the view of
 *     the engine its manifest declares, not the engine.
 *   - Position is honoured. `outer` mods are lifted to the front of the
 *     registry after registering, so they wrap the built-ins instead of
 *     sitting under them.
 *   - Failure is isolated. A mod that throws while registering is removed
 *     whole and reported; the ones after it still load. A half-registered
 *     mod left in the chain is worse than no mod: its hooks run without
 *     whatever its register() was about to set up.
