/**
 * MCP broker — policy table for shared MCP server access.
 *
 * The hook layer sees every MCP tool call the same way it sees a native
 * one: `tool.call` with `isMcp: true` and `mcpServer` set (bridge.ts
 * resolves this from the Tool's mcpInfo — see that commit for why the
 * event itself carries no server field on its own). One matcher on
 * `isMcp` therefore covers every MCP server, regardless of transport or
 * language, with no per-server adapter code.
 *
 * What this can and cannot enforce, stated plainly:
 *
 * MCP connections are already a process-wide singleton today —
 * `connectToServer` in src/services/mcp/client.ts memoizes by server name
 * + config, so every subagent in the process already shares one
 * connection per server with no broker involved. That default is
 * `singleton`. What's actually missing, and what this plugin adds, is
 * SERIALIZATION on top of that sharing: nothing today stops two
 * concurrent calls into the same shared connection from interleaving and
 * corrupting session state (a real risk for something like IDA, which is
 * not built for concurrent commands against one open database). The
 * `singleton` tier here means "one in-flight call at a time," not "one
 * connection" — the connection was already singular.
 *
 * `pool(n)` bounds concurrency to n in-flight calls instead of 1 — for a
 * server that can handle limited concurrency but not unlimited.
 *
 * `per-session` and `isolate` are the tiers a hook genuinely cannot fully
 * deliver: a hook gates and serializes calls into a connection, it cannot
 * change WHICH connection a call is routed to — that routing happens
 * inside client.ts's memoized connectToServer, keyed only by server name
 * and config, with no session dimension. So what's implemented here is a
 * coarser, honest approximation: first-claim ownership with a lease. The
 * first session to call a `per-session`/`isolate` server becomes its owner;
 * calls from any other session are denied with a clear reason, rather than
 * silently sharing state across a credential boundary. An owner that calls
 * again keeps its claim (heartbeat); one that goes silent past
 * OWNERSHIP_IDLE_TTL_MS — crashed or exited without releasing — lets the
 * next caller take over instead of locking the server away forever. True
 * per-session connection isolation would need the memoization key in
 * client.ts to include session identity — that's a separate, deeper change
 * than a hook can make.
 *
 * Policy is data, not code — the same philosophy as schedulerHook's model
 * routing table: addPolicy()/removePolicy() at runtime, matched by glob
 * against the server name, most-recently-added wins.
 *
 * Progress notifications (a proposed concern for a broker: "route them
 * back to the right session after forwarding"): verified, not built. A
 * call's onProgress callback is a plain JS closure carried through the
 * event object; awaiting next(e) here — even queued behind a singleton
 * lock or a pool semaphore — never detaches it from the call that owns
 * it, confirmed with two concurrent singleton-serialized calls whose
 * progress events never cross-delivered. Session-routing infrastructure
 * only becomes necessary once a call actually crosses a process boundary,
 * which nothing in this file does; that belongs with whatever eventually
 * implements transparent remote offload, not speculatively here.
