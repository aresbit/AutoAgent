/**
 * Built-in algebraic-effect hook plugins.
 *
 * Every plugin here earns its slot: it either changes what happens in the
 * chain, or its state is reachable from $. Anything that did neither has
 * been deleted rather than kept as documentation with a register() that
 * registers nothing.
 *
 * ── How they compose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Registration order is nesting order, outermost first, but ordering only
 * matters between plugins sharing an event. Grouped by the event they
 * contend on:
 *
 * tool.call (bridged from PreToolUse — allow / deny / rewrite input /
 * inject context; a returned value other than those is dropped):
 *   mount → mcpBroker → sudo → ctxFork → ptrace → scheduler → replay →
 *   taintFirewall → ipc → transaction → writeGuard → knowledge →
 *   jitSynthesis → adaptive → rsi*
 *   Guards sit outermost so a denial short-circuits before observers spend
 *   work; adaptive is innermost so it sees the input every guard allowed.
 *
 * tool.invoke (⊥ is the real tool execution — this is where a hook can
 * REPLACE the computation or re-run it):
 *   ctxFork → retry → cache → adaptive
 *   retry outside cache: a retry should be able to hit the cache on its
 *   second attempt. cache outside adaptive: a served hit is not a failure
 *   to learn from.
 *
 * tool.content (the resume value becomes what the model sees):
 *   plainLanguage → select → replay → taintFirewall → mprotect →
 *   transaction → compress → contextShunt → contextHandle → knowledge
 *   contextHandle runs innermost and turns a large result into
 *   "[handle:…] + preview"; contextShunt wraps it and upgrades that preview
 *   to a worker-model summary; compress wraps both and only ever sees what
 *   slipped past them (the 12K-16K band). Scanners (taint, mprotect) sit
 *   outside the narrowing so they inspect full content, not a summary.
 *
 * tool.error / session.* / subagent.*: observers only, order irrelevant.
 *
 * perfTelescopy registers '*' and is first, so it wraps every hook above:
 * a cache hit deep in the chain, a denial from mount, a rewrite from an
 * antibody guard all surface as one consistently-measured span.
 *
 * ── Off by default (they act, so acting is opt-in) ────────────────────
 *
 * - cache: shadow mode; measures hit rate, serves nothing. Read is never
 *   served even when enabled — FileReadTool dedups repeat reads better.
 * - transaction: records what it would have rolled back; does not write.
 * - taintFirewall: records secrets and would-be blocks; does not block.
 * - contextShunt is the exception — ON, and the only hook here that makes
 *   a network call.
 *
 * ── UI ring ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Synchronous ui.slot.render / ui.press hooks dispatched by uiDispatcher.ts
 * from inside React render. They touch none of the events above, so their
 * order relative to the rest is irrelevant; each owns a distinct slot id:
 * uiContextGauge ("context-gauge"), uiSubagentDashboard
 * ("subagent-dashboard"), uiGitStatus ("git-status"), uiFold
 * ("tool-result"), uiRsiHeartbeat ("rsi-heartbeat" + toasts).

 * Measured rather than guessed: driving the real chain with 200 tool calls,
 * the whole hook layer costs 0.86ms per call — negligible against a Read, let
 * alone a Bash or an API round trip. So cost is not why these are off.
 *
 * Effect is. After those 200 calls each plugin was asked what it had recorded,
 * and this set had recorded nothing and changed nothing. That is not damning
 * on its own — a guard that never fires is a guard doing its job, and mount,
 * sudo, writeGuard, taintFirewall, mprotect, ipc and transaction stay on for
 * exactly that reason. The difference is that these are not waiting for
 * anything: they are unfinished experiments and diagnostics that run on every
 * tool call and produce output nobody reads.
 *
 * perfTelescopy is the clearest case — it hooks '*', so it is the single most
 * invoked plugin in the process, and its output is a latency histogram that
 * exists to be looked at during an investigation. That is a thing to switch on
 * when investigating, not to pay for on every call forever.
 *
 * They are not deleted: each is one call away via enableOptInPlugins().
